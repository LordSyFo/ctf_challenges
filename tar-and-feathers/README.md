the first file is corrupted -> restore with bzip2recover

the next file is an inception of tar archive files -> run my tarxception.py to uncompress all files and store the file names in dump-file

convert dump-file to bytestring with python

dump-file turns out to be another archive -> extract

gives top.png, runme.py and offsets.py

dummy step: dump the dumpfile into a newline seperated file with all the file-names from the recovered archive

extract offset bytes from the dumpfile and output to 'out'

out is a pdf-file open and show text behind black box.
